## Code Challenge: Class 35

- Sarah Glass for 401 Python

- Collaborated with Anthony, Dan, Andrew, Slava, and Logan in the class at a Remo table

**Description:**

Feature Tasks:

- Implement your own Graph. The graph should be represented as an adjacency list, and should include the following methods:

- add vertex: Arguments: value, Returns: The added vertex, Add a vertex to the graph
- add edge: Arguments: 2 vertices to be connected by the edge, weight (optional), Returns: nothing, Adds a new edge between two vertices in the graph, If specified, assign a weight to the edge, Both vertices should already be in the Graph
- get vertices: Arguments: none, Returns all of the vertices in the graph as a collection (set, list, or similar), Empty collection returned if there are no vertices
- get neighbors: Arguments: vertex, Returns a collection of edges connected to the given vertex, Include the weight of the connection in the returned collection, Empty collection returned if there are no vertices
- size: Arguments: none, Returns the total number of vertices in the graph, 0 if there are none

### Whiteboard Process

No Whitebard for Data Structures on Fridays.

### Approach & Efficiency

Multiple classes and functions created.

### Solution

[Stack](data_structures/graph.py)

### Chat GPT Prompt & Code Help

No code help besides peer help in Remo and following the class demo.
